# The following are the review and remarks for Sales force automation (SMS) system


·         The SMS system is fine

·         The format of summary has been revised and attached in excel file

·         The dashboard is fine but should be exportable to excel

·         Should be able to filter in three fields (area wise, Sales person wise ,Store ID wise)

·         Should be able to see date to date summary and print report of sales/orders per day
